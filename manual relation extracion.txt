Polarization of light
is
harnessed in an abundance of classical and quantum applications.

Characterizing polarization in a classical sense
is done
resoundingly successfully using the Stokes parameters, and numerous proposals offer new quantum counterparts of this characterization.

The latter often
rely on
distance measures from completely polarized or unpolarized light.

We here
show
that the accepted class of perfectly polarized quantum states of light
is
severely lacking in terms of both pure states and mixed states.

By appealing to symmetry and geometry arguments we
determine
all of the states corresponding to perfect polarization,
and
show that the accepted class of completely polarized quantum states
is
only a subset of our result.

We
use
this result to reinterpret the canonical degree of polarization, commenting on its interpretation for classical and quantum light.

Our results
are
necessary for any further characterizations of light's polarization.

-----------------------2---------------------
We
study
how quantum randomness generation based on unbiased measurements on a hydrogen-like atom can get compromised by virtue of the unavoidable coupling of the atom with the electromagnetic field.

Concretely, we
show
that an adversary with access to the quantum EM field, but not the atom,
can
perform an attack on the randomness of a set of unbiased quantum measurements.

We
analyze
the light-atom interaction in 3+1 dimensions with no single-mode or rotating-wave approximations.

In our study, we
also take into account
the non-pointlike nature of the atom and the exchanges of angular momentum between atom and field and compare with previous results obtained under scalar approximations.

We
show
that preparing the atom in the ground state in the presence of no field excitations
is, in general,
not the safest state to generate randomness in atomic systems (such as trapped ions or optical lattices).

-----------------------3---------------------
We
study
electron transfer between two separated nuclei using local control theory.

By conditioning the algorithm in a symmetric system formed by two protons, one can favored slow transfer processes, where tunneling is the main mechanism, achieving transfer efficiencies close to unity assuming fixed nuclei.

The solution
can be
parametrized using sequences of pump and dump pi pulses,

where the pump pulse
is
used to excite the electron to a highly excited state where the time for tunneling to the target nuclei is on the order of femtoseconds.

The time delay
must be chosen
to allow for full population transfer via tunneling,

and the dump pulse
is chosen
to remove energy from the state to avoid tunneling back to the original proton.

Finally, we
study
the effect of the nuclear kinetic energy on the transfer efficiency.

Even in the absence of relative motion between the protons,

the spreading of the nuclear wave function
is
enough to reduce the yield of electronic transfer to less than one half.

-----------------------4---------------------
We
show
that maximal families of mutually unbiased bases are characterized in all dimensions by partitioned unitary error bases, up to a choice of a family of Hadamards.

Furthermore, we
give
a new construction of partitioned unitary error bases, and thus maximal families of mutually unbiased bases, from a finite field, which is simpler and more direct than previous proposals.

We
introduce
new tensor diagrammatic characterizations of maximal families of mutually unbiased bases, partitioned unitary error bases, and finite fields as algebraic structures defined over Hilbert spaces.

-----------------------5---------------------
We
develop
a quantum-classical hybrid algorithm for function optimization
that is
particularly useful in the training of neural networks since it
makes
use of particular aspects of high-dimensional energy landscapes.


Due to a recent formulation of semi-supervised learning as an optimization problem,

the algorithm
can
further be used to find the optimal model parameters for deep generative models.

In particular, we
present
a truncated saddle-free Newton's method based on recent insight from optimization, analysis of deep neural networks and random matrix theory.

By combining these with the specific quantum subroutines

we
are
able to exhaust quantum computing in order to arrive at a new quantum-classical hybrid algorithm design.

Our algorithm
is
expected to perform at least as well as existing classical algorithms while achieving a polynomial speedup.

The speedup
is
limited by the required classical read-out.

Omitting this requirement can in theory lead to an exponential speedup.

-----------------------6---------------------
The act of describing how a physical process changes a system is the basis for understanding observed phenomena.

For quantum-mechanical processes in particular,

the affect of processes on quantum states profoundly
advances
our knowledge of the natural world, from understanding counter-intuitive concepts to the development of wholly quantum-mechanical technology.

Here, we
show
that quantum-mechanical processes can be quantified using a generic classical-process model through which any classical strategies of mimicry can be ruled out.

We
demonstrate
the success of this formalism using fundamental processes postulated in quantum mechanics, the dynamics of open quantum systems, quantum-information processing, the fusion of entangled photon pairs, and the energy transfer in a photosynthetic pigment-protein complex.

Since our framework
does not depend
on any specifics of the states being processed, it reveals a new class of correlations in the hierarchy between entanglement and Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering and paves the way for the elaboration of a generic method for quantifying physical processes.

-----------------------7---------------------
In every experimental test of a Bell inequality,

we
are
faced with the problem of inefficient detectors.

How we treat the events when no particle
was
detected has a big influence on the properties of the inequality.

In this work, we
study
this influence.

We
show
that the choice of post-processing
can
change the critical detection efficiency, the equivalence between different inequalities or the applicability of the non-signaling principle.

We also
consider
the problem of choosing the optimal post-processing strategy.

We
show
that this is a non-trivial problem and that different strategies are optimal for different ranges of detector efficiencies.

-----------------------8---------------------
We
present
an alternative form of master equation, applicable on the analysis of non-equilibrium dynamics of fermionic open quantum systems.

The formalism
considers
a general scenario, composed by a multipartite quantum system in contact with several reservoirs, each one with a specific chemical potential and in thermal equilibrium.

With the help of Jordan-Wigner transformation, we
perform
a fermion-to-qubit mapping to derive a set of Lindblad superoperators that
can
be straightforwardly used on a wide range of physical setups.

To illustrate our approach, we
explore
the effect of a charge sensor, acting as a probe, over the dynamics of electrons on coupled quantum molecules. The probe consists on a quantum dot attached to source and drain leads, that allows a current flow. The dynamics of populations, entanglement degree and purity show how the probe is behind the sudden deaths and rebirths of entanglement, at short times. Then, the evolution leads the system to an asymptotic state being a statistical mixture. Those are signatures that the probe induces dephasing, a process that destroys the coherence of the quantum system.

-----------------------9---------------------
Applications that envisage utilizing the orbital angular momentum (OAM) at the single photon level
assume
that the OAM degrees of freedom that the photons inherit from the classical wave solutions are orthogonal.

To test this critical assumption, we
quantize
the beam-like solutions of the vector Helmholtz equation from first principles to delineate its elementary quantum mechanical degrees of freedom.

We
show
that although the beam-photon operators do not in general satisfy the canonical commutation relations, implying that the photon states they create are not orthogonal,

the states
are nevertheless
bona fide eigenstates of the number and Hamiltonian operators.

The explicit representation for the photon operators presented in this work
forms
a natural basis to study light-matter interactions and quantum information processing at the single photon level.

-----------------------10---------------------
We
present
an alternative collision model to simulate the dynamics of an open quantum system.

In our model, the unit to represent the environment
is,
instead of the single particle, the block which is consisted of a number of environment particles.

The introduced blocks enable us to
study
the effects of different strategies of system-environment interactions and states of the blocks on the non-Markovianties.

We
demonstrate
our idea in the Gaussian channels of an all-optical system.

We
show
that the non-Markovianity of the channel working in the strategy that the system
collides
with environmental particles in each block in a certain order will be affected by the size of the block and the embedded entanglement.

We
find
that the effects of heating and squeezing the vacuum environmental state will quantitatively enhance the non-Markovianity.

-----------------------11---------------------
Exploiting photonic high-dimensional entanglement
allows
one to expand the bandwidth of quantum communication and information processing protocols through increased photon information capacity.

However, the characterization of entanglement in higher dimensions
is
experimentally challenging because the number of measurements required scales unfavourably with dimension.

While bounds
can
be used to certify high-dimensional entanglement, they do not quantify the degree to which quantum states are entangled.

Here, we
propose
a quantitative measure that is both an entanglement measure and a dimension witness, which we coin the P-concurrence.

We
derive
this measure by requiring entanglement to extend to qubit subspaces that constitute the high-dimensional state.

The computation of the P-concurrence is not contingent on reconstructing the full density matrix, and
requires
less measurements compared to standard quantum state tomography by orders of magnitude.

This
allows
for faster and more efficient characterization of high-dimensional quantum states.

-----------------------12---------------------
Single-photon wave packets
can
carry quantum information between nodes of a quantum network.

An important general operation in photon-based quantum information systems is blind reversal of a photon's temporal wave-packet envelope, that is, the ability to reverse an envelope without knowing the temporal state of the photon.

We
present
an all-optical means for doing so, using nonlinear-optical frequency conversion driven by a short pump pulse.

This scheme
allows
for quantum operations such as a temporal-mode parity sorter.

We also
verify
that the scheme works for arbitrary states (not only single-photon ones) of an unknown wave packet.

-----------------------13---------------------
Referring to a Fano-type model qualitative analogy we
develop
a comprehensive basic mechanism for the laser control of the non-Markovian bath response in strongly coupled Open Quantum Systems (OQS).

A converged Hierarchy Equations Of Motion (HEOM)
is
worked out to numerically solve the master equation of a spin-boson Hamiltonian to reach the reduced electronic density matrix of a heterojunction in the presence of strong THz laser pulses.

Robust and efficient control
is achieved
increasing by a factor ?2 non-Markovianity measured by the time evolution of the volume of accessible states.

The consequences of such fields on the central system populations and coherence are examined, putting the emphasis on the relation between the increase of non- Markovianity and the slowing down of decoherence processes.

-----------------------14---------------------
We
survey
some recent work on topological quantum computation with gapped boundaries and boundary defects and list some open problems.

-----------------------15---------------------
The Schr\"{o}dinger equation ψ"(x)+κ2ψ(x)=0 where κ2=k2−V(x) is rewritten as a more popular form of a second order differential equation through taking a similarity transformation ψ(z)=ϕ(z)u(z) with z=z(x).

The Schr\"{o}dinger invariant IS(x)
can
be calculated directly by the Schwarzian derivative {z,x} and the invariant I(z) of the differential equation uzz+f(z)uz+g(z)u=0.

We
find
an important relation for moving particle as ∇2=−IS(x) and thus
explain
the reason why the Schr\"{o}dinger invariant IS(x) keeps constant.

As an illustration, we
take
the typical Heun differential equation as an object to construct a class of soluble potentials and generalize the previous results through choosing different ρ=z′(x) as before.

We
get
a more general solution z(x) through integrating (z′)2=α1z2+β1z+γ1 directly and it includes all possibilities for those parameters.

Some particular cases are discussed in detail.

-----------------------16---------------------
There is yet no satisfying, agreed-upon interpretation of the quantum-mechanical formalism.

Discussions of different interpretations are ongoing and sometimes hotheaded.

In this note, we
want
to make a clear distinction between the (mathematical) quantum formalism -- and
show
that there is actually more than one -- and its interpretation.

We further
propose
a novel (somewhat minimalistic) reading of the relative-state formalism and argue that the formalism is different from the standard Born and measurement-update rule, regardless of its interpretation.

To do so we
consider
observations of observers -- Wigner's-friend-type experiments -- the feasibility of which remains an open question.

-----------------------17---------------------
We
consider
a dissipative evolution of parametrically-driven qubits-cavity system under the periodical modulation of coupling energy between two subsystems, which
leads
to the amplification of counterrotating processes.

We
reveal
a very rich dynamical behavior of this hybrid system.

In particular, we
find
that the energy dissipation in one of the subsystems can
enhance
quantum effects in another subsystem.

For instance, optimal cavity decay
assists
to stabilize entanglement and quantum correlations between qubits even in the steady state and to compensate finite qubit relaxation.

On the contrary, energy dissipation in qubit subsystem
results
in the enhanced photon production from vacuum for strong modulation, but
destroys
both quantum concurrence and quantum mutual information between qubits.

Our results
provide
deeper insights to nonstationary cavity quantum electrodynamics in context of quantum information processing and might be of importance for dissipative quantum state engineering.

-----------------------18---------------------
Stabilizer codes are a simple and successful class of quantum error-correcting codes.

Yet this success comes in spite of some harsh limitations on the ability of these codes to fault-tolerantly compute.

Here we
introduce
a new metric for these codes, the disjointness, which, roughly speaking, is the number of mostly non-overlapping representatives of any given non-trivial logical Pauli operator.

We
use
the disjointness to prove that transversal gates on error-detecting stabilizer codes are necessarily in a finite level of the Clifford hierarchy.

We also
apply
our techniques to topological code families to find similar bounds on the level of the hierarchy attainable by constant depth circuits, regardless of their geometric locality.

For instance, we can
show
that symmetric 2D surface codes cannot have non-local constant depth circuits for non-Clifford gates.

-----------------------19---------------------
Wigner rotations are transformations that affect spinning particles and cause the observable phenomenon of Thomas precession.

Here
we
study these rotations for arbitrary symmetry groups with a semi-direct product structure.

In particular we
establish
a general link between Wigner rotations and Thomas precession by relating the latter to the holonomies of a certain Berry connection on a momentum orbit.

Along the way we
derive
a formula for infinitesimal, Lie-algebraic transformations of one-particle states.
